## 🎯 Project Introduction

&emsp;&emsp;If 2024 was the inaugural year of the "battle of a hundred models," then 2025 has undoubtedly ushered in the "Year of Agents." The technological focus is shifting from training larger foundation models to building smarter agent applications. However, systematic, practice-oriented tutorials are extremely scarce. For this reason, we launched the Hello-Agents project, hoping to provide the community with a guide for building agent systems from scratch, balancing theory and practice.

&emsp;&emsp;Hello-Agents is a **systematic agent learning tutorial** from the Datawhale community. Currently, Agent construction is mainly divided into two schools: one is software engineering-type Agents like Dify, Coze, and n8n, which are essentially process-driven software development with LLMs serving as data processing backends; the other is AI-native Agents, truly AI-driven Agents. This tutorial aims to lead you to deeply understand and build the latter—true AI Native Agents. The tutorial will guide you to penetrate framework appearances, start from the core principles of agents, delve into their core architecture, understand their classic paradigms, and ultimately build your own multi-agent applications with your own hands. We believe that the best way to learn is through hands-on practice. We hope this tutorial can become your starting point for exploring the world of agents, enabling you to transform from a "user" of large language models to a "builder" of agent systems.

## 💡 How to Learn

&emsp;&emsp;Welcome, future intelligent system builder! Before embarking on this exciting journey, please allow us to give you some clear guidance.

&emsp;&emsp;This project balances theory and practice, aiming to help you systematically master the entire process of designing and developing from single agents to multi-agent systems. Therefore, it is especially suitable for **AI developers, software engineers, students** with some programming foundation, as well as **self-learners** with a strong interest in cutting-edge AI technology. Before learning this project, we hope you have basic Python programming skills and a basic conceptual understanding of large language models (for example, know how to call an LLM through an API). The project focuses on application and construction, so you don't need a deep background in algorithms or model training.

&emsp;&emsp;The project is divided into five major parts, each being a solid step toward the next stage:

- **Part One: Agent and Language Model Fundamentals** (Chapters 1-3), we will start from the definition, types, and development history of agents, sorting out the ins and outs of the concept of "agents" for you. Then, we will quickly consolidate core knowledge of large language models, laying a solid theoretical foundation for your practical journey.

- **Part Two: Building Your Large Language Model Agent** (Chapters 4-7), this is the starting point of your hands-on practice. You will personally implement classic paradigms such as ReAct, experience the convenience of low-code platforms like Coze, and master the application of mainstream frameworks like Langgraph. Finally, we will guide you to build your own agent framework from scratch, giving you the ability to both "use wheels" and "build wheels."

- **Part Three: Advanced Knowledge Extension** (Chapters 8-12), in this part, your agent will "learn" to think and collaborate. We will use the self-developed framework from Part Two to deeply explore core technologies such as memory and retrieval, context engineering, and Agent training, and learn communication protocols between multi-agents. Finally, you will master professional methods for evaluating agent system performance.

- **Part Four: Comprehensive Case Studies** (Chapters 13-15), this is where theory and practice converge. You will integrate what you've learned, personally create intelligent travel assistants, automated deep research agents, and even a cyber town simulating social dynamics, tempering your construction abilities in real and interesting projects.

- **Part Five: Graduation Project and Future Outlook** (Chapter 16), at the end of the journey, you will face a graduation project, building a complete multi-agent application of your own, comprehensively testing your learning outcomes. We will also look forward to the future of agents with you, exploring exciting frontier directions.

&emsp;&emsp;Agents are a rapidly developing field that heavily relies on practice. To achieve the best learning effect, we provide all supporting code in the project's `code` folder. We strongly recommend **combining theory with practice**. Please be sure to personally run, debug, and even modify every piece of code provided in the project. You are welcome to follow Datawhale and other Agent-related communities at any time. When you encounter problems, you can ask questions in the issue section of this project at any time.

&emsp;&emsp;Now, are you ready to enter the wonderful world of agents? Let's set off immediately!
